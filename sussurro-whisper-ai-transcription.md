    <h3>WHAT ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Sussurro Privacy Policy and Terms of use are written by a human (me, Cesare, hi!) to be read by other humans. And you should read it: <a href="https://cdf1982.com/privacy/sussurro_terms_of_service_and_privacy_policy">Privacy Policy and Terms</a>.</li>
      <li>Sussurro relies on OpenAI's Whisper models, which are distributed under the MIT license. However, OpenAI is neither involved nor affiliated with this app.</li>
      <li>Whisper models can be quite large; download them only when you won't incur costs from your provider.</li>
      <li>Transcription speed depends on your device performance and the model you choose.</li>
      <li>Accuracy greatly depends on the source audio quality and the model chosen for transcription.</li>
      <li>Transcriptions may include errors, including significant mistakes.</li>
      <li>Sussurro does not separate different speakers and does not format the output text.</li>
    </ul>
