		<p><b>ClipBar lives in the upper right corner of your Mac and shows what's currently in your pasteboard.</b><br><br>If you have ever put your fingers on the CMD-V keys and stopped wondering what you were going to paste, ClipBar is the small menu bar utility for you.<br><br>The app main purpose is to allow you to <b>quickly check the text you're going to paste</b>, but ClipBar also shows if the pasteboard is currently holding an image (giving you its size) or a file (showing you the path). And when you click on ClipBar, a popover will appear for viewing a larger preview of your untruncated clipboard's content (from which you can extract part of the text or file path), or to actually view the image currently in your pasteboard.<br><br>We copy and paste stuff so many times every day, and yet having the ability to see at a glance what's in the pasteboard before actually pasting it <b>will make you faster and more accurate</b>.</p>

					ClipBar is not a clipboard manager – there's a lot of great apps that do that well already – but it can complement any third party solution you use to manage your pasteboard.<br><br>The app can <b>launch automatically at login</b> and you can <b>configure the maximum length of the text preview, and if longer strings should be truncated at the beginning, in the middle or the end</b>. If you hover your mouse on the Menu Bar item, you will get a full, untruncated preview even for longer texts and file paths. And you can also share your pasteboard's content to other apps directly from ClipBar's popover!<br><br>ClipBar is at home on <b>Big Sur</b> and is built natively for <b>Apple Silicon</b>, but it is also compatible with previous versions of macOS (it requires version <b>10.14 Mojave or newer</b>) and <b>older Intel Macs</b>.
