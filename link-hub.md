			Links are powerful: they send you to a website, but also allow to launch an app, call a friend or trigger any kind of automation.<br><br><b><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1524351956">Link HUB</a> is your dashboard to store and quickly launch important links, being them URLs to visit websites or URL scheme links to run specific Shortcuts, deep-link into apps, execute web-based automations or whatever else you can think of.</b><br><br>If it has a URL, Link HUB can give you a button to launch it: <b>just set a name, paste or type in any valid address, pick a color and you're done... a big button in your hub will let you launch that link at the speed of light.</b><br><br>The only requirement is for you to have important links, automations, apps and web hooks you want to access quickly and to know their specific URLs: with infinite websites and apps providing an URL scheme out there, Link HUB cannot provide a list for you to pick from, and lets you type in anything you want instead. Searching for URL schemes online is usually pretty easy, and most web-services automations like IFTTT or Zapier let you copy fully functional URLs and web hook links.<br><br>You can also configure Link HUB for people you love who are less familiar with technology than yourself, and give them a single place, with easy to tap buttons, to execute multiple operations, including non-trivial ones.<br><br>Finally, and getting even nerdier, not only can Link HUB launch your URLs, but it can also perform HTTP GET calls... great for executing automations such as triggering an Ethernet relay that opens a gate!<br><br><b>Link HUB is a modern iOS and iPad OS app</b> (on the latter, with multitasking and drag and drop support), free to use for up to 4 links.<br><br>Thanks to iCloud, <b>your links sync automatically between devices while staying 100% private.</b><br><br><b>No analytics or prying access to your data</b>: this indie app's sustainability and future development come exclusively from an optional and very inexpensive subscription, when you decide you want unlimited buttons.
