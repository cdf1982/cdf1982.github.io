*Q: Is GlanceCam compatible with macOS 10.15 Catalina?*<br>A: Yes, **GlanceCam is 100% compatible with macOS 10.15 Catalina**.
Things were a bit complicated for a couple of weeks during the beta period, after the launch of Catalina beta 8 (hence the existence of a FAQ), but Catalina beta 9 fixed the issue that GlanceCam and many other applications (Final Cut Pro X, iMovie, GarageBand...) relying on OpenGL were having; if you are running GlanceCam 2.7, the version that has been available on the App Store for a couple of months, **you're ready for macOS 10.15**.
