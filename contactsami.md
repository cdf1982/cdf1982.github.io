	SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS<br>
	ContactsAMI requires macOS 10.12 Sierra or 10.13 High Sierra, a PBX compatible with AMI (Asterisk Manager Interface) and an already configured and working VOIP phone.<br>
	AMI needs to be enabled on your PBX, and you'll need your server configuration (IP, port, etc.) and AMI credentials to set up ContactsAMI. The app will need local access to your Contacts.<br>
	⚠️ ContactsAMI is currently not compatible with macOS 10.14 Mojave; due to security changes in Mojave, ContactsAMI plugin is currently unavailable on the new operating system <i>(and, honestly, it might never be again... it seems those kind of Contacts plugins aren't allowed anymore, and that's a pity)</i> and the app isn't playing nice with Dark Mode either. An updated, Mojave-compatible version will be released as soon as I figure out a way to restore the plugin functionality in some way.
