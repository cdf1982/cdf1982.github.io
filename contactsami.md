>In the meantime, you can [download ContactsAMI free trial]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/ContactsAMI.zip) for macOS.
> Warning: ContactsAMI is currently compatible with macOS 10.12 Sierra and 10.13 High Sierra; due to security changes in macOS 10.14 Mojave, ContactsAMI plugin is currently unavailable on the new operating system (and, honestly, it might never be again... it seems those kind of plugins aren't allowed anymore, and that's a pity) and the actual app isn't playing nice with Dark Mode either. An updated version will follow as soon as I figure out a way to restore the plugin.
