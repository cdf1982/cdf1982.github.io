TameTime approach to privacy is very simple: your data belongs exclusively to you.

TameTime development team cannot see any data (absolutely nothing!) accessed and viewed inside the app or anywhere else on your computer/network while the app is running.

We also want you to know that TameTime doesn't use any other third-party, non-Apple, service to monitor the usage you do of the app (number of times the app is run, for how long, which sections are most popular, etc...) or for any other purpose; to be explicit, TameTime does not communicate with any server run by the development team or third-parties, with the only exception of Apple servers if you enabled the option to share your diagnostics and usage informations with Apple.

If you have any questions regarding this privacy policy, please contact us via email at support@cdf1982.com.

We reserve the right to modify this document; if we do, we will publish those changes on this page, updating the following modification date.
