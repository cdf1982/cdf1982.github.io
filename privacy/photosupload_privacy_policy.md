PhotosUpload approach to privacy is very simple: your data belongs exclusively to you.

PhotosUpload development team cannot view any data (absolutely nothing: not your photos, not your tags, not your server credentials) typed, accessed and viewed inside the app.

The only exception is the automatic configuration data that PhotosUpload inserts in the email draft when you manually initiate a support request from the app: to help us help you, in that case some parameters are collected and pasted inside the email, but you can obviously remove part or all the text inserted automatically before sending your message, so you have complete control of the information you provide in your support request.

We also want you to know that PhotosUpload doesn't use any other third-party, non-Apple, service to monitor the usage you do of the app (number of times the app is run, for how long, which sections are most popular, etc...) or for any other purpose; to be explicit, PhotosUpload does not communicate with any server run by the development team or third-parties, with the only exception of Apple servers if you enabled the option to share your diagnostics and usage informations with Apple.

If you have any questions regarding this privacy policy, please contact us via email at support@cdf1982.com.

We reserve the right to modify this document; if we do, we will publish those changes on this page, updating the following modification date.
