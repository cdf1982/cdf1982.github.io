Sussurro's approach to privacy is very simple: all your data belongs exclusively to you.

This is particularly important for an app that processes audio recordings, as it may handle personal or sensitive information.

For this reason, **Sussurro operates entirely on-device**:
- The app does not include analytics or tracking of any kind;
- The transcription process happens strictly on your device: audio files, whether recorded in-app or imported, never leave your device;
- The transcribed text also remains strictly on your device and is not transmitted anywhere.

Sussurro is based on [OpenAI](https://openai.com)'s [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) models, which are distributed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/LICENSE). However, OpenAI is neither involved in nor affiliated with this project.

The only network activities performed by Sussurro are:
- Fetching a JSON file from my server, which you can [inspect](https://cdf1982.com/sussurro/sussurro-models.json), to retrieve the list of currently supported and available models;
- Downloading the selected models from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co), when the user explicitly chooses to download one.

Please note that Whisper models can be large in size. Downloading them over a cellular network or a metered connection may result in data charges.

**If you decide to use Sussurro, you acknowledge and accept the following Accuracy of Transcription clause**:
Sussurro uses automatic speech recognition (ASR) models to transcribe audio into text. While these models are highly advanced, they are not perfect and may produce errors, including but not limited to:
	•	Incorrect words or phrases
	•	Omitted words
	•	Misinterpretation of accents, dialects, or background noise
	•	Errors in punctuation and formatting
    •   Substantial errors in meaning and concepts
By using Sussurro, you acknowledge that transcriptions may contain inaccuracies, including significant mistakes. It is your responsibility to review and verify the transcribed text before using it for any purpose. The developer is not liable for any consequences resulting from transcription errors, including but not limited to miscommunication, misinformation, or any resulting damages.

With the free version of Sussurro, you can test any supported transcription model with any audio file, but the transcribed text will be shown only up to 300 characters. If you purchase Sussurro Pro, you will be able to see the full transcription on all the devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac) logged into the same Apple ID used for the purchase.

If you have any questions regarding this document, please contact the developer via email at [support@cdf1982.com](support@cdf1982.com).

I reserve the right to modify this document; if I do so, I will publish those changes on this page, updating the following modification date.
