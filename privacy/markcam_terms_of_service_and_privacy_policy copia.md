MarkCam's approach to privacy is very simple: all your data belongs exclusively to you.

This is particularly important for an app can access and modify your photos, as it may handle personal or sensitive information.

For this reason, **MarkCam operates entirely on-device**:
 - The app does not include analytics or tracking of any kind;
- The watermarking process happens strictly on your device: images never leave your device (see note 1 below);
- When you save a watermarked image to your device Photo Library or discard it, nothing is persisted inside MarkCam.

(note 1) If your device is configured to sync images in the Photo Library to iCloud, obviously after adding a watermarked photo to the Library, that one will also be synced; but that's strictly between you and Apple servers, according to the terms of your iCloud account.

If you decide to use MarkCam, you acknowledge and accept that images can processed for the watermarking operations and also resized.

With the free version of MarkCam, you can test the full watermarking capabilities of the app, except for the central watermarking position, which is restricted to MarkCam Pro Users. The free version of MarkCam applies automatically a \"Upgrade to MarkCam Pro\" watermark at the center of the images; please upgrade to the Pro version to start saving images without that message, and please be advised that the overlay on images that have already been saved to the Photo Library will not and cannot be removed after upgrading.

If you have any questions regarding this document, please contact the developer via email at [support@cdf1982.com](support@cdf1982.com).

I reserve the right to modify this document; if I do so, I will publish those changes on this page, updating the following modification date.
