The LifePace application (the "App") is made available to you by Cesare Forelli ("I", "Me" or "My") subject to these Terms of Service (the "Terms"), along with the Privacy Policy, which together form the complete agreement between you and Me regarding the App. By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms, as well as the Terms specified by Apple for the App Store, which is the sole distribution channel of LifePace. If you do not agree with any of these Terms, please do not use the App.

## License and Use
- I grant you a personal, limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to use the App on supported Apple devices you own or control that are signed in with your Apple ID.  
- You may not reverse engineer, decompile, modify, or redistribute the App.  
- The App is intended for personal productivity and habit tracking; you agree not to rely on it in critical, medical, or emergency contexts.  
- You acknowledge and agree that the App, the LifePace name, its code, design, and all related intellectual property are owned by Me and protected by applicable laws.  
- All trademarks, logos, and service marks displayed in the App are the property of their respective owners.  

## Features and Purchases
- The free version of LifePace allows you to create and track 1 habit with access to all features.  
- To unlock unlimited habits, you may upgrade to LifePace Pro, available either:  
  1. as an annual auto-renewing subscription, or  
  2. as a lifetime one-time purchase (which includes Family Sharing).  
- Both options unlock the same features; pricing and availability may change.  
- All purchases are handled by Apple via the App Store. I do not process payments or store your payment details.  
- Subscriptions renew automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can manage or cancel subscriptions in your App Store account settings.  
- All sales are final. Refunds, if any, are subject to Appleâ€™s policies.  

## Data and Privacy
- The App stores your habit data locally on your device. If you enable iCloud, your data syncs securely via your private iCloud account.  
- I cannot access your iCloud data.  
- Please review the Privacy Policy for full details on how data is handled. [[in-app link to the Privacy Policy view]]  

## Disclaimer of Warranties and Liability
- The App is provided "as is" and without warranties of any kind, express or implied. I do not guarantee that the App will be error-free, uninterrupted, or suitable for your particular needs. You acknowledge that data losses or sync issues between devices may occur, and you agree not to store information of economic or otherwise personally significant value in the App.  
- To the maximum extent permitted by law, I shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use of the App.  
- You use the App at your own risk and remain responsible for backing up your data. In the Settings section of the App, there is an Export function that allows you to extract your data in CSV format.  

## Modifications and Termination
- I may update or change the App, these Terms, or the Privacy Policy at any time. Updated Terms will be published with a revised date. By continuing to use the App after changes are posted, you agree to the updated Terms.  
- I reserve the right to update the App to add or remove features and supported platforms. While I do not currently plan to do so, I may discontinue the App at any time, with or without notice.  

## Applicable Law
- These Terms are governed by Italian law. Any disputes shall be resolved exclusively in the courts of Savona, Italy.  
- If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect, reflecting as closely as possible the original intent of the parties.
