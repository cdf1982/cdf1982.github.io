ClipBar approach to privacy is very simple: all your data belongs exclusively to you.

This is particularly important when displaying your Mac's pasteboard data, as it may contain sensitive informations such as passwords, privileged informations, banking details, etc.

For this reason, **ClipBar only works locally on your Mac**:
- The app is completely sandboxed;
- It does not connect to any server managed by the developer... and better than that, it never accesses the Internet (ever);
- It does not store your pasteboard (clipboard) content or history on disk (only the current pasteboard entry is kept in memory and shown in the Menu Bar, but pasteboard's data is never persistently stored on disk or anywhere else except your RAM, where it's kept only while the app is running);
- It does not include any third party framework or library for analytics, sync or anything else.

**IMPORTANT! Before installing and using ClipBar you need to assess if you are comfortable with how the app works and especially decide if showing the pasteboard's content on screen does not pose a risk for your security: ClipBar shows whatever is your current pasteboard content in the Menu Bar; this might include sensible informations, such as passwords, shown in plain text on screen. If you work in an environment where other people can access your Mac - in person or remotely - you might not want to use ClipBar, or quit it temporarily when you're around other people or screen-sharing. If you install and use ClipBar, you explicitly accept how the app works and indemnify its developer for any inconvenience or damage may occur as a consequence of your pasteboard's data being shown on-screen.**
