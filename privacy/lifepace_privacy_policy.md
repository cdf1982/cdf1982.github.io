LifePace's approach to privacy is simple: your habits and their history belong exclusively to you.

## How LifePace stores and processes data
- Your data is stored locally on your device;  
- If your device has iCloud enabled, your data syncs via your private iCloud (using Apple's CloudKit Private Database) to your devices signed in with the same Apple ID;  
- LifePace's developer cannot access your private CloudKit database: Apple handles encryption in transit and at rest.  

## Analytics and tracking
LifePace does not include analytics, telemetry, or third-party tracking libraries of any kind.  

## Network activity performed by LifePace
- iCloud sync when enabled (CloudKit) to keep your habits and history up to date across devices;  
- System services required by Apple platforms (e.g., iCloud, App Store receipts) when applicable.  

## Notifications
LifePace uses local notifications for habit reminders. Notification content is generated on-device. Interactions (Complete/Skip/Remind Later) update your local data and, if iCloud is enabled, changes sync via iCloud.  

## Widgets and Apple Watch
Widgets and the Watch app access your local data through something called "shared App Group container", a private on-device storage accessible exclusively to LifePace's app and extensions. They do not send your data anywhere; when iCloud sync is enabled on the device, Apple handles synchronization.  

## Apple Intelligence (on-device AI)
LifePace's AI features run on-device using Apple Intelligence. Habits and statistics are not transmitted to external services by LifePace. In the app's Settings you can disable all Apple Intelligence features in LifePace.  

## Account and payments
Purchases and subscriptions are handled by Apple via the App Store. LifePace does not process or store your payment information and the LifePace developer has no access to your name, email address, or payment information, unless you initiate a direct contact per the following section and decide to share your name or other information for debugging purposes.
