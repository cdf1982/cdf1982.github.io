SendScan's approach to privacy is simple: your scanned documents and workflows belong exclusively to you.

## How SendScan stores and processes data
- Your scanned documents are stored locally on your device;
- If your device has iCloud enabled, your documents sync via your private iCloud Drive to your devices signed in with the same Apple ID;
 Your workflow configurations are also stored in iCloud Drive and sync across your devices;
- SendScan's developer cannot access your private iCloud Drive: Apple handles encryption in transit and at rest.

## Analytics and tracking
SendScan does not include analytics, telemetry, or third‑party tracking libraries of any kind.  

## Network activity performed by SendScan
- iCloud sync when enabled (CloudKit) to keep your habits and history up to date across devices;  
- System services required by Apple platforms (e.g., iCloud, App Store receipts) when applicable.  

## Widgets and Shortcuts
Widgets and Shortcuts access your workflow configurations through a shared App Group container, a private on-device storage accessible exclusively to SendScan's app and extensions. They do not send your data anywhere; when iCloud sync is enabled on the device, Apple handles synchronization.

## Account and payments
Purchases and Subscriptions are handled by Apple via the App Store. SendScan does not process or store your payment information and the SendScan developer has no access to your name, email address, or payment information, unless you initiate a direct contact per the following section and decide to share your name or other information for debugging purposes.
