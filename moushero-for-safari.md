		<h2>Customize Safari's Right-Click with Powerful Automations</h2>
		<p>
			<b>MousHero is a Safari extension that adds automation superpowers to your browsing experience: trigger URL actions by adding up to 3 custom context menu items to Safari's right-click menu.</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			You'll be able to <b>launch apps, services and automations</b> (for instance with third party applications such as Shortcuts, Keyboard Maestro, Drafts, etc.), optionally passing the currently selected text, destination link, current page URL and title as parameters.

		<h3>Powerful Safari Automation Examples</h3>
		<p>
			<b><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/moushero-for-safari/moushero-documentation-and-examples.html">MousHero Documentation</a> lists URL examples for many use cases</b>, but here's a few ideas of what you'll be able to achieve with just a right-click inside Safari:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Run your Shortcuts, optionally passing the selected text as parameter;</li>
			<li>Create a new note in Drafts with the selected text and site URL, or skip the note creation and directly execute a Drafts action on the selection;</li>
			<li>Add the selected text as task in OmniFocus, with the link in the notes;</li>
			<li>Run Keyboard Maestro automations with the selection as parameter;</li>
			<li>Open any website;</li>
			<li>Search the selection on any website: Amazon, StackOverflow, Google maps, etc.</li>
		</ul>
