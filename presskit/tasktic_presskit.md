**Tasktic is a powerful, yet easy to use task manager app for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch**.

It offers many advanced functionalities usually available only in expensive productivity apps:

-   Unlimited tasks, with optional due date and notification
-   Projects
-   Tags
-   Sync between devices (via iCloud)
-   Siri and Reminders for Mac integration
-   Recurring tasks (every *n* hours, days, weekdays or months, with optional end)
-   Statistics and achievements
-   Tasktic has a Notification Center widget, a share extension and a Watch app
-   Multitasking is supported on compatible iPads

**Tasktic is free ** with some limitations to the most advanced features (max 3 projects, no tags, no stats / achievements, no recurring tasks).

Users have the option to upgrade to **Tasktic Pro** (an in-app purchase that costs just $4.99) to unlock everything, forever.

For users who really love the app, **Tasktic Pro Big Supporter** is a $9.99 in-app purchase that offers the same functionality of the Pro version, plus a special virtual achievement to show our appreciation for the great support.

With Tasktic 1.5, we've also introduced **Tasktic Pro Value Edition**, a release specifically targeted to students, veterans and people looking for a job; this in-app purchase offers the same advanced features of Tasktic Pro for only $ 3.99.

Tasktic is a Swift app crafted in Italy by [Cesare Forelli](https://twitter.com/cdf1982). Development began in February 2015 and the app launched on November 10, 2015; the latest version is Tasktic 1.5 (available on the App Store since July 25, 2016). It is currently localized in English and Italian.
