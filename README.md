# cdf1982 personal website

Forked from [Forty Jekyll Theme](andrewbanchich/forty-jekyll-theme), a Jekyll version of the "Forty" theme by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/).  

Please refer to the original themes if you want to adopt the theme for your projects: I'm taking shortcuts and editing files just to achieve my desired results with my personal website.
