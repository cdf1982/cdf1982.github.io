So, I decided to honor the not-so-Italian tradition of Thanksgiving / Black Friday sales by [discounting TameTime](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tametime-awareness-timer/id1479326723?l=it&ls=1&mt=12) for a few days.

I programmed [TameTime]({{ site.baseurl }}/tametime) to remind myself of moving around every once in a while: my back only gives me a break if *I* give it a break at least once per hour, by standing and walking around. TameTime nudges me to do so with notifications, sounds and even a (brief) full-screen overlay for the times I really, really only need five more minutes on top of the last five more minutes...

TameTime can make a difference for people who suffer from computer-related stress and pain. If you or someone you know has these issue, this promo is a great way of saving 50%: **until Saturday, [TameTime is only $ 2,49 in the Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tametime-awareness-timer/id1479326723?l=it&ls=1&mt=12)**!

Happy Thanksgiving, and thank you for being here!
