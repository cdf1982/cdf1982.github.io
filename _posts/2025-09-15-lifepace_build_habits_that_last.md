For years I wanted a **habit tracker that helped build consistency without getting in the way**.

It's not like I strive to be a _quantified self guru_, but keeping track of some things is nice and I believe long streaks are powerful: when you have one going you think twice before breaking it!

The apps I tried never clicked for me: they were either slow (really long presses just to mark a habit done, distracting home screens with more marketing fluff than I can tolerate...) or unnecessarily rigid, with a limited number of habits trackable and the expectation that you never missed a day. If I forget to check off a habit one day, and you make me dig through convoluted menus to fix that, we won't be friends for long...  

All these annoyances lead me to build [**LifePace**](https://cdf1982.com/lifepace/lifepace.html): I wanted a habit tracker that is fast to use, forgiving when life gets in the way, truly private, and always motivating. A companion designed to **turn good intentions into long-lasting results** by staying out of the way while being available where you need it.


### **Why should you consider giving LifePace a try?**

You can [**download LifePace today on the App Store for free**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lifepace-habit-streaks-tracker/id6751773159), and you really should, because **consistency is the foundation of real progress**.

Big changes don't come from sudden leaps, but from the small steps we repeat daily; any software developer can tell you that's very true: you show up every day and move the needle a little bit, [no 0 days](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/comment/cdah4af/).

LifePace is designed to make taking those daily steps easier:

- **Human streaks**: celebrate consistency without punishing the occasional skip.
- **Optional Hard Mode**: for stricter goals that don't allow slips (for instance, when fighting addiction).
- **Smart schedules & reminders**: customisable nudges that actually help, not overwhelm.
- **Widgets & complications everywhere, plus Siri & Shortcuts** as first class citizens: check and complete habits everywhere, from the Lock Screen, Home Screen, Control Center, Apple Watch and embed actions into your personal automations.
- **Private by design**: iCloud sync, optional Face ID unlock, no ads, no analytics.
- **Apple Intelligence**: on-device summaries and habit suggestions, with a toggle to turn it off.

From day one, LifePace works seamlessly on **iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch**.


### **The design**

I like to say LifePace has _the right amount_ of **Liquid Glass** and local **Apple Intelligence**: the interface is modern and motivating without being too much, while on-device foundation models provide summaries and suggestions you can actually use.

You can choose between **List** and **Grid** views, enjoy clear stats and graphs, and rely on subtle haptics and sounds that make every completion satisfying. Above all, interactions are immediate and frictionless: a single tap to complete (double-tap on grids), with quick access to your full history.


### **Just the beginning**

LifePace 1.0 launches alongside iOS 26 and macOS Tahoe on **Monday, September 15**.

It's free to try (track 1 habit) with a fair **Pro upgrade** for unlimited habits: you can choose your level of commitment with a yearly subscription and a lifetime unlock.

Today is just the start, and I'm excited to keep improving LifePace with your feedback.

Launching a new app is always both exciting and a little terrifying: you spend _so_ many hours designing, coding, testing, polishingâ€¦ and then you press "release" and hope someone notices. If you're reading this, it means you did, and I couldn't be more grateful.

I'd love to hear your thoughts about LifePace! Feedback is [always welcome](mailto:support@cdf1982.com), and if you enjoy the app, a 5-stars review on the App Store goes a long way in helping an indie dev like me.

[**Download LifePace today on the App Store**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lifepace-habit-streaks-tracker/id6751773159) and start building habits that last!
