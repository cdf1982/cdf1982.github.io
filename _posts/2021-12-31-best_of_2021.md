I'm compiling 2021's list at the very last moment, in a bit of a rush and not really feeling it.

After this super-inspiring introduction, here's what I picked for 2021 (same categories I used the past few years, and as always no affiliate links):

**Best song**: [Chvrches's Final Girl](https://music.apple.com/it/album/final-girl/1568746173?i=1568746329), and the whole album is great.

**Best album**: [Cassadee Pope's Thrive](https://music.apple.com/it/album/thrive/1587378544), and especially What the Stars See, Say it First and Break Too.

**Best book**: _TFW you realize a year went by without you reading a decent book..._ ðŸ˜¬

**Best movie**: [Danny Collins](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1772288/?ref_=rt_li_tt), which I saw on January 3. Honorable mentions: [I Care a Lot](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9893250/?ref_=rt_li_tt) and a pretty unknown and slow-paced movie, [10 Items or Less](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499603/?ref_=rt_li_tt), which I very much enjoyed.

**Best TV show**: [The O.C.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362359/?ref_=rt_li_tt). Yes, really. Runner up: [The Americans](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2149175/?ref_=rt_li_tt). In other news, I believe 2021 was a rather terrible year for new shows...

**Best podcast**: My choice for the media category I dedicate most time falls on a big podcast I actually started enjoying so much more this year, [Cortex](https://www.relay.fm/cortex).

**Best tech podcast**: I think I'm going to kill this award, it's always the usual suspects...

**Best investigative reporting podcast**: [The Dropout](https://abcaudio.com/podcasts/the-dropout/), which is actually so much better that [Bad Blood The Final Chapter](https://www.threeuncannyfour.com/show/bad-blood/).

**Best news article I read**: [How an Excel TikToker manifested her way to making six figures a day](https://www.theverge.com/22807858/tiktok-influencer-microsoft-excel-instagram-decoder-podcast?utm_source=pocket&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=pockethits)

**Best Mac app**: It took me a while to set it up just the way I want it, but this year's winner is easily [Timing](https://timingapp.com).

**Best iOS app**: I've been using it for years, but I realize I never awarded one of my most used apps, [News Explorer](https://betamagic.nl/products/newsexplorer.html). Great on macOS too, actually.

**Best videogame**: It's been the killer application [convincing me](https://twitter.com/cdf1982/status/1475636668354945025) to buy a Xbox Series S, and I understand I'm awarding it mostly for the graphics and the amazingly vast open world... but [Forza Horizon 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYH9n37B7Yw) is an easy pick for me.

**Best video**: If you have a dozen hour or so, [President Biden's Inauguration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umsaXWrpgR8&list=LL&index=35) is my choice, for all it represented. Can you believe January 6 is less than a year ago? Fun fact, it's the [second time](https://cdf1982.com/2017/12/30/best_of_2017.html) Joe Biden wins this category. The guy will go places!

Happy new year! ****ðŸ¥‚ to a best, safe and healthy 2022!**
