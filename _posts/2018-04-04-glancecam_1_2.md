I'm very thankful for how well the launch of [GlanceCam](https://www.cdf1982.com/glancecam) is going: being [another](https://www.cdf1982.com/contactsami) niche product, I wasn't sure there would be a market for it, and instead the number of sales has so far exceeded my (modest) expectations. Thank you!

Here's what's new in GlanceCam 1.2, already [available on the Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glancecam-ip-webcam-viewer/id1360797896?l=it&ls=1&mt=12):

-   You can now **save a PNG snapshot of the video** to the your Pictures folder by hitting CMD+S, clicking the Save icon, or selecting "Save snapshot" in the File menu.
-   GlanceCam **didn't restore the window size and position** between sessions; now **that bug has been fixed**, and it will stay just where you want it on your screen every time you launch the app.

Thank you for using GlanceCam! If you know someone who might find it useful, I'll really appreciate the word of mouth!
