**[GlanceCam 2.8](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glancecam-ip-webcam-viewer/id1360797896?l=it&ls=1&mt=12) is now available in the App Store and brings improvements to the app's automation capabilities**:
- The already existent URL scheme (*glancecam://?camera=01*, where 01 is the camera number as ordered in the app Preferences) now also works when the app is not running: it launches GlanceCam and *then* selects the camera you specified in the URL scheme.
- There's also a new action available via URL scheme: *glancecam://?fullscreen=true* (or false) sets the fullscreen mode of GlanceCam on and off; please be advised that this is not a toggle: if GlanceCam is already fullscreen and you ask it to enter it again, by design nothing will happen.
- You can also combine multiple URL scheme actions in a single string: *glancecam://?camera=02&fullscreen=true* selects the second camera AND enters fullscreen... how convenient!
- GlanceCam now supports AppleScript too, both for switching cameras and setting the fullscreen mode:
```applescript
tell application "GlanceCam"
	select camera 2
	set fullscreen true
end tell
```

Shipping this update took longer than usual due to some hiccups in my code related to tips... a warm thank you goes to the very patient person (or persons) of Apple's App Review who very gracefully waited for a bug to be squashed and to [Matt](https://twitter.com/mattie), who once again helped me when I found myself out of my depth. 
**Go take a sneak peak at his amazing Go editor for macOS, [Chime](https://www.chimehq.com)**! As much as you'll want to, you can't lay your hands on it yet, because it's still in closed beta, but it looks amazing and it will be worth the wait.
