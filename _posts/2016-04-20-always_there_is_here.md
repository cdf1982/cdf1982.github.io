Today a brand new app joins [Tasktic]({{ site.baseurl }}/tasktic.html) and [Weightrack](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/weightrack-record-your-weight/id906894500?mt=8&at=1000l3L9): [Always There](h{{ site.baseurl }}/always-there.html)!

Always There allows you to keep your most precious photo always there (ahem....) in a Notification Center widget of your iPhone and iPad.

Just pull down Notification Center and an amazing picture of the person you love, a funny photo of your puppy or an image that inspires and motivates you will be there for you!
