A couple of days ago [ClipBar 1.3 became available in the Mac App Store](https://cdf1982.com/2020/11/24/my-new-app-clipbar.html) with two handy features:
- You can now share the current content of your pasteboard (be it text or an image) to other apps with the share button in the lower left corner of ClipBar's popover (which appears when you click on the app in the Menu Bar).
- ClipBar popover is now more effective when you have copied a bunch of text and want to keep only part of it: when the popover is visible, select the text you want to keep and either right-click and copy, or hit CMD+C.

I can't express how grateful I am for how [ClipBar]({{ site.baseurl }}/clipbar) has been welcomed: the app has reached **over 180 upvotes on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/clipbar)**, pretty cool for a nerdy utility!
