In case you missed my constant self-promotion on Mastodon ðŸ™ƒ, this week I introduced [**LifePace**](https://cdf1982.com/lifepace/lifepace.html), my new habit tracker for iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe and Apple Watch.  
LifePace is designed to give you the **structure to stay consistent** and build progress, one small step at a time.  

Today Iâ€™m happy to share the first update: **LifePace 1.1** focuses on **speed** and **more effective reminders**, so you can keep moving forward with less effort:

- **Much faster performance**  
  You know how they say about the best plans not resisting an encounter with reality? Turns out that Users importing a decade of data from other apps stress-test your app on a whole different level, and that's a good thing for everyone because now scrolling through long histories, checking stats, and completing habits is smoother and more responsive for everyone.  

- **Full-screen alarms**  
  On iOS 26 and iPadOS 26, you can now enable AlarmKit-based **full-screen alarms** for habits you never want to miss, just like wake-up alarms.  
  On devices that donâ€™t support AlarmKit (like the Mac), LifePace continues to use standard notifications. By default, reminders remain gentle everywhere: you decide which habits deserve an alarm by toggling **Alarms** on in each habitâ€™s configuration.  

- **Focused Review view**  
  The Review screen now shows only your **active habits**.  

If you havenâ€™t already, you can [**download LifePace today on the App Store for free**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lifepace-habit-streaks-tracker/id6751773159).

And if you find it useful, a 5-star review really helps others discover LifePace, and **LifePace Pro** will let you track unlimited habits while fueling future updates.  

Thanks for being part of this journey!
