There's a fun trend on Mastodon, listing one's default apps; here's mine.  

Everything's been very stable for years, with a couple new entries in 2023: GoodLinks replaced Pocket, iTerm stole Terminal.app job and VSCode, surprisingly, entered my life despite being a disgusting Electron app.

Oh, I was to lazy to add links (with one exception ;) and there are a couple additional sections I didn't see in other lists at the bottom.
