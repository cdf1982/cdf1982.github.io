GlanceCam [just introduced](https://www.cdf1982.com/blog/2018/5/8/glancecam-20-multi-cameras-and-multi-actions) multi-cameras and multi-actions support in version 2.0, but there's already something new and improved for you in the 2.1 release [already available in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glancecam-ip-webcam-viewer/id1360797896?l=it&ls=1&mt=12):

* Tooltips everywhere! If you're not sure about a button or a field, just hover your mouse and a helpful suggestion will appear.
* When you resize the window with a keyboard shortcut (CMD + 0, CMD +1 or CMD + 2) and the new size extends outside the screen, the resized window will bounce back to be fully visible.
* Sometimes, GlanceCam took the "always on top" preference a little too literally, and stayed actually on top of *everything*, including the screensaver; now that bug has been fixed.
* Another bug fix: in Preferences, when you added a new camera, the tabulation between textfields didn't behave properly; now everything works as expected.
I'm trying to make GlanceCam the best IP camera viewer possible, and Users' support helps a lot; if you can, please show your love with a review on the App Store or by leaving a nice tip inside GlanceCam's Preferences. Thank you!
