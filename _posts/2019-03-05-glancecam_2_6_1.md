GlanceCam 2.6.1 automatically stops playback just before your Mac goes to sleep, and resumes it immediately after the system wakes up.

This helps stabilize the behavior of some camera models with the new continuous playback (an option to never pause the stream when the app is minimized or the screen is locked) introduced in GlanceCam 2.6: occasionally I did experience an issue after the Mac woke from sleep and the video stream stayed frozen for a few seconds (or, in rare cases, did not resume at all).
Now the system's sleep/wake cycle determines the stream to be properly stopped and resumed, avoiding freezes of any kind.

[GlanceCam 2.6.1](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glancecam-ip-webcam-viewer/id1360797896?l=it&ls=1&mt=12) is now available as a free update.
