No matter how much you test a new feature, bugs find a way to sail off to keep company to your code when you ship...

GlanceCam 2.4.1 is currently in review and fixes a bug that prevented the app to enter fullscreen mode and to appear in Exposé; this happened only when visibility in all Spaces is enabled, and it turns out I didn’t test those cases well enough. Sorry!
