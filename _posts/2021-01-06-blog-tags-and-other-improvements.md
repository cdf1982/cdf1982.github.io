Since forever, most posts on this blog have been tagged, but I never actually exposed those tags.

This changed today: now all my posts show their tag at the bottom, and [there's a page listing all tags]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags) for quick access to categories.

While I was working on my site, I also fixed an issue that prevented banner images from being shown inside the post pages (they only appeared in the main blog page ðŸ˜¬).

I challenged myself to blog more this year; **subscribe to my [RSS feed](https://cdf1982.com/feed.xml)** to see if I succeed!
