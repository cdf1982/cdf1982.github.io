Tasktic 1.3 is now [available for download on the App Store](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/tasktic-manage-your-tasks/id1036139076?mt=8&at=1000l3L9&ct=website), and it brings our task manager much closer to you, **right on your wrist**!

Tasktic for Apple Watch is a simple app, designed for quick interactions on the go: it allows you to **quickly add tasks to Inbox by dictating them to Siri** and it also lets you **review all your tasks due today and tomorrow**.
