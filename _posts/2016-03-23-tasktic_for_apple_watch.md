Tasktic 1.3 is now [available for download on the App Store](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/tasktic-manage-your-tasks/id1036139076?mt=8&at=1000l3L9&ct=website), and it brings our task manager much closer to you, **right on your wrist**!

Tasktic for Apple Watch is a simple app, designed for quick interactions on the go: it allows you to **quickly add tasks to Inbox by dictating them to Siri** and it also lets you **review all your tasks due today and tomorrow**.

Tasktic Pro and Pro Big Supporter users can also view overdue tasks directly from Tasktic for Apple Watch by enabling the option inside Tasktic for iOS Settings.

Tasktic for Apple Watch is the first in **a series of new features we're working on and plan to introduce this spring**... follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/taskticapp) and subscribe to our [RSS feed]({{ site.baseurl }}/feed.xml) to never miss an update!
