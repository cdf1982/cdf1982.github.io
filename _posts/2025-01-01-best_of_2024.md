A bit later than _[usual](https://cdf1982.com/tag/best-of-the-year)_ here's my best-of-the-year post.

Same categories from previous years and no affiliate links; I'm in a bit of a rush, so just the list of things I really liked this year, without comments:

**Best song**: [Full of Life](https://music.apple.com/it/album/full-of-life/1675341859?i=1675342966) from Christine and the Queens

**Best album**: [The Tortured Poets Department](https://music.apple.com/it/album/the-tortured-poets-department/1736268193) from Taylor Swift

**Best book**: Lots of Micheal Connelly, Patterson and Grisham for me this year, and really no "best" award to give out...

**Best movie**: [Oppenheimer](https://www.imdb.com/it/title/tt15398776/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1)
