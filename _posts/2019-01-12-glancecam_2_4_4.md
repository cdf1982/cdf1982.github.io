Apple just approved a new update of [GlanceCam](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glancecam-ip-webcam-viewer/id1360797896?l=it&ls=1&mt=12); here's what is improved in version 2.4.4:

- Insta-zoom (the feature [introduced in version 2.4]({{ site.baseurl }}/2018/11/30/glancecam_2_4.html) that allows you to clic and hold the right mouse button to temporarily zoom the view) works better with high-resolution streams because now the zoomed window can never resize more than the actual screen size.
- When GlanceCam was not active, the "Save snapshot" floppy and the always on top "Eye" icons were a bit pale; now they are more defined and look better.
