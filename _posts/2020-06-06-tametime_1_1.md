App Review was so fast, a new release of TameTime [hit the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tametime-awareness-timer/id1479326723?l=it&ls=1&mt=12) before I could blog about it.

[TameTime]({{ site.baseurl }}/tametime) is my utility for being aware of the time spent in front of your Mac without taking breaks (which are automatically detected) and can help in fighting RSI and other computer-related stress.

Version 1.1 adds a feature requested by a User: the app can now alert you not only when your session lasts over a certain amount of time, but also multiple times when you are so much in the zone that you keep working for 2, 3 times longer your original alert threshold. As always, alerts can be sounds, notifications, even a screen overlay, or a combination of these methods, at your preference.
