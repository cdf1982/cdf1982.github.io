ðŸš€ TameTime now natively supports Apple Silicon and is fully at home on macOS 11 Big Sur.

TameTime is my utility for being aware of the time spent in front of your Mac without taking breaks (which are automatically detected) and can help in fighting RSI and other computer-related stress... it helps me every day!

**Download TameTime [now on the Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tametime-awareness-timer/id1479326723?l=it&ls=1&mt=12)**!
