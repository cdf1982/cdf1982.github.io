As I announced [earlier this week](https://www.cdf1982.com/blog/2017/6/5/its-been-a-while), I submitted a new app to Apple.

[**Walk More: powerful pedometer for step counting**](https://www.cdf1982.com/walk-more) is my fourth app and it is **[available for download](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/walk-more-powerful-pedometer-for-step-counting/id1198077980?mt=8&at=1000l3L9&ct=website)**.

Walk More is a simple iPhone app with a dynamic dark look and lively orange accents. It helps you to keep track of:

-   **Every step you take** when you have your iPhone with you.
-   **The distance you walk** (in miles or kilometers).
-   **How many stairs you climb** (iPhone 6 or newer required).

You can set a **daily goal**, see your progress inside the **Notification Center widget** and review your **statistics and top results** with the help of simple **graphs**.

**Walk More is free, and [you should download it right now](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/walk-more-powerful-pedometer-for-step-counting/id1198077980?mt=8&at=1000l3L9&ct=website)**: seeing your progress every day can really help you achieving a healthier lifestyle!
