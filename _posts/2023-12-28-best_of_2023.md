It appears that in 2022 I wasn't in the mood for writing my _usual_ [best-of-the-year](https://cdf1982.com/tag/best-of-the-year) post, which is odd because I mostly collect things throughout the year and I quite enjoy writing (and reading) such collections.

Here's my picks for 2023, using the same categories of the years before; as always, no affiliate links, just stuff I enjoyed.

**Best song**: Don't know if you've heard of this Taylor Swift gal... [Castles Crumbling](https://music.apple.com/it/album/castles-crumbling-taylors-version-from-the-vault-feat/1690839749?i=1690841083) is a pretty great song, and the fact it also features Hayley Williams is the perfect cherry on top.

**Best album**: So, there's this emerging artist that released a good album, [Midnights](https://music.apple.com/it/album/midnights/1649434004)...

**Best book**: Don Winslow's [Missing - New York](https://books.apple.com/it/book/missing-new-york/id931769335) was hard to put down.

**Best movie**: [A Most Violent Year](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2937898/) came out in 2014, but I only found out about it this year and it was so superior to anything else I've watched that it easily takes the _award_.

**Best TV show**: This is extremely hard, I've seen multiple excellent shows, old and new, and my (not-so) short list includes:
- [The Last of Us](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3581920/?ref_=rt_li_tt)
- [The Mandalorian](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8111088/?ref_=rt_li_tt)
- [Veronica Mars](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412253/?ref_=rt_li_tt) (3rd rewatch)
- [The Expanse](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854/?ref_=rt_li_tt)
- [Silo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14688458/?ref_=rt_li_tt)
- [Special Ops Lioness](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13111078/?ref_=rt_li_tt)

... but I can only pick one.

_After All These Years, Do You Not Instinctively..._ know it's Veronica Mars?
Oh, and the obligatory _fuck you Rob Thomas_ goes here.

**Best podcast**: [This is Love episode 63 - Sampson and Baylor](https://overcast.fm/+2hmWyOQ7c), and keep tissues at hand. Also good: [Cautionary Tales - The Hero Who Rode His Segway Off a Cliff](https://overcast.fm/+5K6al4LGU)

**Best article I read**: Before AI fatigue kicked in, I did really enjoy Kevin Roose's [A Conversation With Bingâ€™s Chatbot Left Me Deeply Unsettled](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-microsoft-chatgpt.html), but I don't know if I'd feel the same reading it now for the first time.

**Best Mac app**: A new entry! [Rectangle Pro](https://rectangleapp.com/pro) is by far, and I mean _by far_, the best window manager I've tried. And I tried them all.

**Best iOS app**: If you met me, you know [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) always _makes the list_, and with the recent release of version 4, great on all platforms but especially versatile and fast on iOS, it's an extremely easy pick.

**Best videogame**: [Tears of the Kingdom](https://zelda.nintendo.com/tears-of-the-kingdom/) or [Return to Monkey Island](https://returntomonkeyisland.com)? Just getting one game that's so good would make a year shine. But in the end, Guybrush will always have my loyalty, even if the ending really made me sad.

**Best video**: Tough choice: humans [make incredible things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGPjFFMD3c0&list=FLn0XxNj34RZDB05nByGXdjQ&index=22), [really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLrVxEJ7pZ8&list=FLn0XxNj34RZDB05nByGXdjQ&index=15). But I think this [Dog Mountain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLudqeJRsCw&list=FLn0XxNj34RZDB05nByGXdjQ&index=4) video is the best thing I've watched in a long time.

Thanks for reading, I hope you've found something interesting here!

**Wish you a very happy 2024! ðŸ¥‚**
