This December I didn't really feel like writing this post, or anything really, but I also do not want to break the streak of *Best of* posts after a [few]({{ site.baseurl }}/2017/12/30/best_of_2017.html) [years]({{ site.baseurl }}/2018/12/28/best_of_2018.html) publishing them. So, here are my picks (same categories as 2018, no affiliate links):

**Best song**: An easy one for me, [Lying Down by CÃ©line Dion](https://music.apple.com/it/album/lying-down/1479480850?i=1479480854).

**Best album**: I can't say I have a pick. I just started an Apple Music subscription, so hopefully in 2020 I'll find something new and nice to listen to, as the year that ends today was not great for music, in my opinion.

**Best book**: [Wish You Well by David Baldacci](https://books.apple.com/it/book/wish-you-well/id787565354) is a lovely, old school and heart-warming story, and definitely the best book I've read this year.

**Best movie**: I'm having a hard time choosing between [Green Book](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6966692/?ref_=rt_li_tt), [The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7533152/?ref_=rt_li_tt) and [Mia and White Lion](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4844148/?ref_=rt_li_tt), so I'm not picking one, and recommending all three of them.

**Best TV show**: Another easy pick after best song, [For All Mankind](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7772588/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) was a really great TV series, and I miss it already.

**Best podcast**: [ATP](https://atp.fm) is an easy choice this year, because the Mac Pro shipped and we recently got the episodes we all were expecting ðŸ˜‰.

**Best tech podcast**: I found myself listening to [Automators](https://www.relay.fm/automators) as soon as a new episode releases, and I honestly can't say the same for other more established podcasts.

**Best investigative reporting podcast**: [Bundyville The Remnant](https://www.opb.org/news/article/bundyville-occupation-podcast/) was as good as the first season, which by the way was my pick for 2018.

**Best news article I read**: My memory these days is not good enough to pick an older article, but [A Conversation With Rudy Giuliani Over Bloody Marys at the Mark Hotel](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/12/a-conversation-with-rudy-giuliani-over-bloody-marys.html) is already a perfectly appropriate choice for the times we live in.

**Best Mac app**: I can't say I discovered a groudbreaking new Mac app this year (how surprising, no Catalyst great app yet ðŸ˜›), but I love [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) as much as one year ago, so I'm confirming my pick for 2019 too.

**Best iOS app**: [Pushcut](https://www.pushcut.io) is a very neat utility to make Shortcuts even more useful and was a good candidate, but I'm going to give my award to the [Tractive](https://tractive.com) iOS app, as it's really well made, feature complete and useful to my peace of mind every single day.

**Best videogame**: I played so little games this year, my choice is basically restricted to the games available in Apple Arcade during the month I kept the free subscrition alive. So, not an expert opinion here, but Sayonara Wild Hearts is certainly worth playing to.

**Best video**: I'm leaving you with something inspirational... [NASA's How We Are Going to the Moon](https://youtu.be/_T8cn2J13-4).

I wish you the best 2020 possible.
