I like that this January I am being able to spend a little more time in Xcode than my usual, but I should probably apologize because all my posts are product announcements... I promise the next time you’ll read me I will cover more entertaining topics!

First, an announcement: **starting tomorrow and for a week only, one of my first apps, [Always There]({{ site.baseurl }}/always-there.html), will be [completely free](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/always-there-your-most-precious-photo-in-notification/id1104703747?mt=8) to download**.
The app allows you to put a special photo in Notification Center, both on iPhone and iPad, and is perfectly useful even with the latest Apple devices.
Always There usually costs $ 1.99 (it’s my only iOS app paid upfront), but I’m trying to understand if there’s potentially a wider market with a different business model: I have ideas for new features, but I need to understand if spending a significant amount of time on them makes at least some sense. If you’re curious, tomorrow [check Always There out]( https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/always-there-your-most-precious-photo-in-notification/id1104703747?mt=8 ) and tell your friends about it!

And now, the app updates...

A few days ago Apple approved [GlanceCam 2.5](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glancecam-ip-webcam-viewer/id1360797896?l=it&ls=1&mt=12), with support for the RTMP protocol.
I can hear you scream “booooring”, but it’s a useful compatibility update if your camera didn’t support RTSP or HTTP for streaming.

Tonight I also submitted an update for [Walk More](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/walk-more-powerful-pedometer/id1198077980?mt=88), my free iOS [pedometer]({{ site.baseurl }}/walk-more.html).
I wasn’t expecting to update it [so soon]({{ site.baseurl }}/2019/01/07/ walk_more_1_3_and_glancecam_2_4_2.html), but a few bugs emerged and I had to fix them right away:
- Steps, distance and floors are again centered vertically near each bar.
- If you ever saw days' labels duplicated on the Y axis of the graph, rejoice: everything is back to normal.
- Sometimes the widget crashed and showed no progress in Notification Center; now it works perfectly.

Hopefully the approval process will go smoothly and in a couple of days tops version 1.4 will be available for download.

Thanks for reading!
