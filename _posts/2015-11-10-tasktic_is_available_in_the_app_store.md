Well, it took a few days [longer]({{ site.baseurl }}/2015/11/05/being_too_optimistic.html) than I initially planned, but starting today you can **become a more organized person** with a little help from [Tasktic]({{ site.baseurl }}/tasktic.html), our powerful and easy to use task manager!

**[Download Tasktic now](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/tasktic-manage-your-tasks/id1036139076?mt=8&at=1000l3L9&ct=blog)**, free on the App Store for your iPhone and iPad, and manage your tasks to accomplish more!
