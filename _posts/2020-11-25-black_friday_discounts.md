To honor and show my appreciation for my American friends, this year I have decided to put 4 of my apps on sale, worldwide, for 3 days!

- **[GlanceCam - IP Cam Viewer](https://apps.apple.com/app/glancecam-ip-webcam-viewer/id1360797896) is 40% off**, now only $ 2.99. This is GlanceCam's first sale since the launch 2.5 years ago and a unique opportunity to take advantage of inexpensive webcams on your Mac!
- **[Link HUB - URL Dashboard & NFC](https://apps.apple.com/app/link-hub-url-dashboard-nfc/id1524351956) 1 year subscription is 50% off**! At $ 1.99, this is a steal for using the app to automate URLs on iOS, iPadOS and macOS!
- **[TameTime: Awareness Times](https://apps.apple.com/app/tametime-awareness-timer/id1479326723) is also 50% off**, and for only $ 1.99 is a great investment on your health, and a "must recommend" for your friends and family who sit long hours at their Mac.
- **[PhotosUpload - FTP uploader](https://apps.apple.com/app/photosupload/id1441656535)** is the nichest app of them all, allowing you to upload photos on a FTP server you have access to from your iPhone and iPad, and so it gets the biggest discount, only $ 0.99 (**67% off** the regular price!).

It might take a few hours for the App Store to propagate the price changes, but the apps are **on sale until Friday!**

Happy and safe Thanksgiving!
