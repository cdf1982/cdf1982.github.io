Just taking a quick moment to acknowledge  a significant milestone for [GlanceCam](https://www.glancecam.app): today my beloved IP camera viewer for Mac **reached 500 Mac App Store ratings**.

The 4.2 average might not sound like much, but for a niche and nerdy app that requires some network knowledge and a bit of setup – therefore getting the occasional 1-star from people who didn't really _read the label_ – is actually pretty good, and I feel great because it's only going up.

It took 5.5 years to get here, but I am determined to get to 1.000 – with at least 4.5 stars average – by March 29, 2025, GlanceCam's [7th birthday](https://cdf1982.com/2018/03/29/glancecam_is_here.html). A bit ambitious, but isn't that what goals are for?
