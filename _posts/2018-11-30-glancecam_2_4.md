I finally got around adding a small but very useful [GlanceCam]({{ site.baseurl }}/glancecam.html) feature that I always wanted for myself ðŸ˜ƒ.

Version 2.4, currently waiting for review from Apple, is great if you usually keep a small GlanceCam window in a corner of your screen to keep an eye on a camera: you can now right-click and hold down the mouse button anywhere inside the window to temporarily zoom the camera at 2x of the natural size; when you release the mouse key, the window will return to its original size and position.

No animations, no manual resizing or keyboard shortcuts necessary: just an additional, quick way to get the most out of your cameras directly from your mouse and without interrupting your workflow.

Keep an eye to the App Store to [download](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glancecam-ip-webcam-viewer/id1360797896?l=it&ls=1&mt=12) GlanceCam 2.4 while it's fresh out of the oven!

I also formalized GlanceCam's [Privacy Policy]({{ site.baseurl }}/privacy/glancecam_privacy_policy.html), so you can have absolute peace of mind about your data.
