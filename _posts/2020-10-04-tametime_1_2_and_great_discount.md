üöÄ TameTime 1.2 debuts today in the App Store, 50% off for 1 week, to remind you to take regular breaks and avoid spending too much time sitting at your Mac at the expense of your health.

This new version adds manual pauses ‚è∏ for conference calls and the ability to repeat your custom alerts at multiples of your "minor" time threshold (i.e. every 10 minutes), and not only for the "major" one (i.e. every hour)!

**Download TameTime [now on the Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tametime-awareness-timer/id1479326723?l=it&ls=1&mt=12)**!
