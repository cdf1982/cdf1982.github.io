Some say that the most useful apps are made to fulfill a need of their developers. That's certainly the case for [**ContactsAMI**]({{ site.baseurl }}/contactsami.html), a simple utility that I made to save myself *a lot* of time.

I've recently installed a [VOIP PBX](http://amzn.to/2GBMgWE) and [phones](http://amzn.to/2GAml1K) at work (in the next few weeks I plan to write a brief tutorial about that, for beginners like I was 3 months ago), and finally something I've always wanted was within reach: **dial a phone number without typing it on the phone, something we do with cell phones but seems so hard on desk handsets**.

Enter ContactsAMI, a **macOS app** that lives in your menu bar with a complimentary **plugin for your Mac's default Contacts app**.

With ContacsAMI, you can initiate (originate, for Asterisk connoisseurs) VOIP phone calls using your existing PBX supporting AMI (Asterisk Manager Interface): just **select who you want to call and your VOIP phone will start ringing; when you'll pick up, a new phone call will be made to the contact you selected**.

ContactsAMI is now available to anyone who wants to leave the past behind and never type a phone number again.

You can [try ContactsAMI for free]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/ContactsAMI.zip) for 7 days and experience its convenience while verifying that it is compatible with your setup; if the trial will convince you that typing phone numbers is archaic, and *it absolutely is*, you'll be able to purchase an unlimited license for just $ 9.99.

Never type a phone number again, let ContactsAMI make your calls!
