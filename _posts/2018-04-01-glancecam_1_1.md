A quick update to [GlanceCam]({{ site.baseurl }}/glancecam.html)... Version 1.1 introduces:

-   New **keyboard shortcuts** for resizing the window to 50% (CMD+0), 100% (CMD+1) or 200% (CMD+2) of the original stream video size.
-   A bug fix: GlanceCam 1.0 prevented the screensaver from starting; **now the screensaver works as expected**, and the video stream is paused not only when the app is minimized in the Dock, but also whenever the screen is locked.

You can find GlanceCam 1.1 on the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glancecam-ip-webcam-viewer/id1360797896?l=it&ls=1&mt=12).

Happy Easter! üê£
