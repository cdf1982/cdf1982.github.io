I don’t link to other blogs often, but [this post](https://bekahhw.github.io/blog/2019/01/01/I've-coded-for-365-days-straight-and-here's-what-I-learned) by [@BekahHW](https://mobile.twitter.com/BekahHW) really means something to me.

I absolutely can’t say that I’ve coded every day in 2018, and I’m not sure I‘ll be able to do it this year either, but it’s absolutely true for me: the more I write code, the more I want to immerse myself in Xcode the next day.
