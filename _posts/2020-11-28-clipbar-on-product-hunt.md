A few days ago, my friend [Chris](https://twitter.com/chrishannah/status/1331290803969421314) made me the nicest gift and hunted my new app [ClipBar]({{ site.baseurl }}/clipbar) on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/clipbar) ðŸ˜¸.

**Today, totally out of the blue, the app gained momentum on PH and â€“ while I'm writing this â€“ it has reached 60 upvotes, which I consider amazing for such a niche product!**

If you're into PH, and you should because it's a lovely community centered on building up people and ideas, **please take a look, let me know what you think and consider sharing it and/or showing your support with an upvote**: I'm really proud for Clipbar achieving this unexpected result after less than 4 days from its under-the-radar launch, and I am working to release version 1.3 tomorrow, which will include a popover for previewing long text and images.

I almost forgot, ClipBar is available [on the Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clipbar-pasteboard-viewer/id1541739143)!
