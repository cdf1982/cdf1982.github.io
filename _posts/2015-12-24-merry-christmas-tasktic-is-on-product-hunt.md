I had a quick post planned for today, to **wish you and your families a merry Christmas** and to officially announce the much requested new feature that's coming in Tasktic 1.3 next January, but a few minutes ago I've received an amazing gift from Tasktic's best friend [Chris Hannah](https://twitter.com/chrishannah) of [AppRecap.net](http://www.apprecap.net/): **today he submitted Tasktic to Product Hunt**!

So, I'm here to wish you the best Christmas possible, and also to ask you to **[check Tasktic out on PH](https://www.producthunt.com/tech/tasktic), and maybe - if you think it deserves it - give it the gift of your upvote, helping it to reach the home page**...

What about the new feature in version 1.3, you ask? Let's just say that I hope you'll find a certain *timepiece* under the tree.

Merry Christmas, I already know mine will be good because having the chance of being on Product Hunt is a dream come true!
