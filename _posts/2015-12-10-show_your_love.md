Just a quick note to ask for your support...

If you enjoy using Tasktic, please take 5 seconds to rate it ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ on [The Great Apps](http://www.thegreatapps.com/apps/tasktic/)[ and](http://www.thegreatapps.com/apps/tasktic/) give it the boost it needs to be noticed by lots of users.

I really appreciate your vote!

Since we're here, I also want you to know that Tasktic 1.2 is coming soon (it will be submitted later today to Apple for review) and I'm already at work for Tasktic 1.3, which will bring a much requested new feature!
