My sister's cat Amelie has always been very much into YouTube cat games (yes, they are a thing), so I accepted a recent suggestion to make some games for her.
Since this is a rainy weekend, that has **quickly escalated to a new YouTube channel: [Amelie's Approved Cat Games](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5V1AwyB7LBK55kY3CWxLhg)**.
Third video's uploading now, but please don't judge them with human standards: just place your feline friend in front of a big screen, and if they enjoy it, than mission accomplished!
