The last post here on cdf1982.com was appropriately named "[Cultivate bad ideas]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/08/17/cultivate_bad_ideas.html)", and I have indeed pursued a lot of ideas in the last 8 months.

One (me) might actually say that I have bitten off more than I can chew, considering my day job and other personal commitments...

To be specific, I have worked on - and skillfully avoided completion of:

-   Tasktic 2.0 (80% done, but the last 20%... let's just say it will take a few more months to release it);
-   A new Apple TV media player (currently nothing more than a stub);
-   Walk More, my take on pedometer apps (more on that later);
-   A secret project;
-   Setting up a Virtual Private Server, just to see how hard it was (it's not) and to be prepared for future needs.

I believe that all those ideas are good and worth pursuing, just not *all at the same time*.

So, today I submitted [**Walk More**]({{ site.baseurl }}/walk-more.html) to the App Store; I would have liked to add a couple more features to version 1.0, but tbh the core functionality is there (and has been for months), as is the overall look and feel of the app (which I very much like), and it's time to start shipping products again.

Reaching the release of an app, and placing another (the media player) in the parking lot, will free up a bit of mental space and, also important, should stop me from feeling guilty every time I think of opening TextMate instead of Xcode: I completely stopped blogging in the last months because I tried to prioritize software development, but writing more commentary posts about tech news was one of my goals for 2017.

So, let's start WWDC week planning to watch a lot of sessions, blog a bit more and focus all my development work on one app at a time (starting with that secret project mentioned above)!

In the meantime, I'll let you know when Walk More will be available for download... please [let me know ](https://twitter.com/cdf1982)if you'll enjoy it!
