I've had a bit of fun with [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/) today; I posted two new macros on the excellent KM [forum](https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com), but seems only appropriate to link to them here on the blog too:

1. The first macro [starts the local Jekyll server and open my localhost website in Safari](https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/t/start-local-jekyll-server-and-open-safari-macro/13787/2) and is great because my mind treats `bundle exec jekyll serve` like a random sequence, inverting the order of the words every time I type them.

2. The second one [opens all the App Store Connect sections I visit every day in separate tabs](https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/t/open-app-store-connect-panels-for-previous-day/13792), setting the date to the previous day as I used to do manually 👏 every 👏 single 👏 day 👏.

Hope these automation examples are useful / inspiring!
