Today marks an important milestone for [my IP camera viewer for Mac](https://glancecam.app): **GlanceCam 3 is [now available in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glancecam-ip-webcam-viewer/id1360797896?l=it&ls=1&mt=12)!** 🎉

Launching an update you've worked on for two years is *a peculiar experience*: it's *exciting* to finally share something you're proud of, it's *a relief* to have those few frustrating moments finally behind you (it's never all smooth sailing, isn't it?), and it is also a bit *terrifying* to think all those hours of designing, coding, testing, making videos, timidly attempting some marketing and writing documentation *might go unnoticed*.

So, let's take a deep breath and launch 🚀 GlanceCam 3: today is a big day and, since **_you_** are reading this, **someone _is noticing_...** 🥰 grazie!

First, a 30 seconds introduction 🎬 to GlanceCam 3:

The new website **[glancecam.app](https://glancecam.app)** also debuts today with lots details and screenshots.<br>There's a [Media Kit]({{ site.baseurl }}/glancecam-mediakit/) available to the Press and **[quite detailed release notes](https://cdf1982.com/glancecam/glancecam-release-notes)** for those who want to know *everything* about the app.

A few **key points about GlanceCam and its biggest update yet**:

- GlanceCam is a **native IP camera viewer for Mac compatible with most models, because it supports standard streaming protocols**.<br>It's a great way to stream in realtime without dealing with browsers, abandoned plugins and apps inspired by Windows 3.1 [Hot Dog stand](https://blog.codinghorror.com/a-tribute-to-the-windows-31-hot-dog-stand-color-scheme/).

- The app launched in 2018, costs $ 3.99 in the Mac App Store, received **20 free updates** to date and is well liked in its small niche, with **215 App Store ratings averaging 4.1 stars** as of today.

- My focus for version 3 was to **improve the first experience and configuration process**, which inevitably is a bit technical because every camera manufacturer does things in their special way 🙄, **while adding advanced features Users** have been asking for *(cough, multi-windows, cough)*.

- With this update I am introducing **GlanceCam Pro**, a new optional tier for Users with advanced requirements.<br>GlanceCam Pro is offered either as a life-time in-app purchase (buy once, keep it forever) at $ 22.99 or as a subscription at $ 8.99 per year; some Users strongly prefer one option over the other, so I made both available, but they share exactly the same feature-set:

	- **Open as many cameras as you need in separate windows and independently resize and arrange them around your screen**; their position is remembered when you relaunch the app, whenever technically possible *(maybe 3% of the time macOS begs to differ, and macOS always wins... ;)*.<br>Opening multiple cameras at the same time is by far what Users requested more often since launch, so it's the tent-pole feature of GlanceCam 3 (and *getting it right* is the reason it took me *2 years* to ship this update 🙃);
	- An optional **Minimalistic user interface** that hides everything but your camera when you're not interacting with the app;
	- Custom aspect-ratios, including non-standard manual proportions;
	- Priority human support via email in less than 24 hours, Monday through Friday;
	- 14 funny alternative icons (most drawn by me, but you’ll certainly like those designed by my friends [Becky Hansmeyer](https://beckyhansmeyer.com) and [Rob Poulter](https://headtilt.me) more!) are available while the app is running.
	
- Obviously, GlanceCam Users who do not need such advanced features were also front and center in my mind the whole time, and **the free update to the regular version is also a big one**:

	- A **new Preferences window** makes the configuration process easier; I understand Preferences are often an afterthought, but for my app they are the first thing a User sees while dealing with the not-always-straightforward process of retrieving their camera parameters, so making them look better and actually simpler to use might be as important as multi-windows.
	- There's a new, and gorgeous if I dare say so myself, **app icon designed by my friend [Becky](https://beckyhansmeyer.com)**; she did an amazing job, and you should buy her apps 😃!
	- Tooltips and help are *everywhere*, including in a new quick onboarding video (told you, I'm a *videographer* now 😎) that assists Users move their first steps in the configuration process; I am especially happy to have finally written **extensive documentation in the form of [Frequently Asked Questions](https://cdf1982.com/glancecam/faqs)**;
	- Aspect-ratios are now auto-detected;
	- Insta-zoom (right-click and hold to temporarily maximise a camera), going in and out of full-screen and resizing in general are faster and more reliable (on ultra-wide screens too, *now* 😬);
	- One of the most essential features of GlanceCam, **Always on top** – a camera optionally hovering above all other windows – now has a (way less useful, IMHO) counterpart, but Users asked... you can now send a camera **Behind everything**. Like, behind your Desktop icons, at the same level of the background. Why, do you ask? I really don't know, but I am only the carpenter here, and Users are always right.

- Finally, there are a few obligatory 🐛🔫 & 🏋️‍♀️ (bug fixes and improvements).

It's a substantial update, and I hope with all my heart Users will love it as much as I loved building it.

If you think GlanceCam 3 looks cool, please give it a boost 😺 on **[Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/glancecam)**, making this launch day even more special!
