I feel like today this website reached a milestone: finally, all product pages are online, albeit some descriptions could be improved and I could add more screenshots of the apps.

Jekyll is proving a really good engine, very easy to extend, and I really love the theme I chose (though I still need to figure out how to change the CSS for a specific product page); working with markdown files and Git for version control is a blessing in flexibility and is truly making me want to post more.

I hope you like my website too, and please let me know if you find anything that's broken (I'm not aware of bugs, but that never stopped them from existing).
