A few days ago I had to take a few photos at work, and my extended usage of [PhotosUpload]({{ site.baseurl }}/photosupload) "in the field" brought up a few tweaks I felt were could improve the app.

Enter PhotosUpload 1.1. This new version includes:
- A new upload progression view (basically, a HUD with a progress indicator and a *7/20* upload counter);
- A recap, at the bottom of the list, of the total number of photos and the number of images already uploaded;
- Minor bug fixes (the main one being a jumpy scrolling of the tableview while uploading many photos that is now gone).

I also edited the metadata in the App Store from a plain app name to "PhotosUpload - FTP uploader", hopefully helping discoverability, and added the system-default "ask for review" prompt after a successful upload operation. Marketing!

After launching the app, I got feedback requesting SFTP support; I'm pretty busy right now (mainly my jobby job and, when I can, working on [GlanceCam](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glancecam-ip-webcam-viewer/id1360797896?l=it&ls=1&mt=12) 3.0), but I can see that coming sometimes in the future. Stay tuned!

Obviously PhotosUpload 1.1 is a free update [available right now on the iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photosupload/id1441656535).
