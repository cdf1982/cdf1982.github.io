In many ways, a *"You asked for pro machines? Here's your* 🤬 *pro machine!"* silent statement (make your comparisons with that explicit *"can't innovate anymore my..."* of yore), Apple now offers a true successor of the Power Mac / Mac Pro that erases all the mistakes made with the Trashcan introduced in 2013 and let languish until yesterday.

First, let me say [I couldn't have been more wrong](https://twitter.com/cdf1982/status/1134746060486828032) about 👏 every 👏 single 👏 prediction 👏:

>Starting at 4.499 $<br>
ARM only, base model 16 cores<br>
32GB ram - 1 TB storage<br>
Apple-only GPU<br>
Small tower<br>
Ships in early 2020

I don't mind, though, because the real product is something to behold.

I like the look of the case, even though the Cheese-grater was even cooler in my opinion (because it was more square), but what matters is that it is *big*, *it will cool its components*, and it is *very much expandable and upgradeable*.

It also costs like a car, and the base configuration (8 core Xeon, 256 Gb M.2 drive) is a bit underwhelming.

I disagree with the idea that pro desktops need to start at 5.000 $ (iMac Pro) or more (look, at least, at 8.000 $ for a better-speced Mac Pro in the real world) and are mostly used for producing video; my impression is also that the Apple tax is increasing steeply on some wrong use-cases assumptions, and that **there is still space for a middle way between the Mac Mini and the new Pro**.

Having said that, if you need something like this, you need it and it's great they still make computers that push the limits... just a couple of years ago, it wasn't really the case.
**Hoping for a true pro machine from Apple, not a powered-up iMac, was more about the statement it would give us about their actual commitment to the future of the Mac than anything else**, so complaining about the price is actually beside the point: let it cost what it needs to cost for them to keep innovating, and just admire it without buying (at that price, not really a choice ;)... it's basically a halo car, and the things they'll learn here will improve other Macs in the future.
