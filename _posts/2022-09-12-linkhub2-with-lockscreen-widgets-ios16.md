Just as iOS 16 lands on your iPhone today, **[Link HUB 2.0 -  URL Launcher & Widgets](https://cdf1982.com/link-hub.html) is also available on iPhone, iPad and Mac**!

**[Download it now](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1524351956) for free to unlock a _level of speed and productivity unimaginable_ before**!

Thanks to the **new Lock screen Widgets** for iOS 16, the **apps, Shortcuts and URLs you rely upon the most are only one tap away**, in any moment; *all widgets sizes* for the lock-screen are supported, and for each one you can choose if you want an opaque background or a less-intrusive look, so your iPhone can serve your needs while perfectly matching your style!

Just a few **examples of what you can do directly from your iPhone's lock screen with Link HUB's _superpowers_**:
- Open any app you want, and in some of them â€“ with the right URL â€“ navigate to specific sections
- Launch automations from Shortcuts... basically _Link HUB is the shortcut to your Shortcuts' shortcuts_ ðŸ¤ª
- Start a FaceTime call to your special someone
- Jump directly into a conversation in Messages
- Open any website

But *there's more*: in Link HUB 2.0 widgets aren't only on your lockscreenâ€¦ you can now add as many **super-high density "regular" Widgets** as you like!
While the small widget is a big convenient button for just one link, a medium widget can contain up to 8 links, a large one 16 and the extra-large widget on iPads makes 32 links available to youâ€¦ that's _double_ of what most alternatives (including Shortcuts' native ones ðŸ˜‰) offer, and you can have them on all platforms: **iOS, iPadOS and macOS**!

Version 2.0 also includes a **redesigned** (in SwiftUI!), **clean and easy to use screen to add and edit URLs**, the ability to _finally_ select **custom icons for every link**, and improved speed and reliability.

Obviously, all the beloved features of Link HUB remain: it's still **free for up to 4 links**, when you first launch the app there's a **quick tutorial and some example links to get you started even if you never worked with URL schemes before**, everything **syncs via iCloud**, you can choose that some links should only appear on certain classes of devices, you can even **program and read NFC tags** (this nerdy and super-useful feature requires a subscription to **Link HUB Pro**, which also unlocks **unlimited links for just $ 4.99 per year**), or send **HTTP GET requests** ðŸ¤“ for IoT automations.

Link HUB 2.0 is the 8th free update since Link HUB's launch 2 years ago and I think you'll love it. I also hope that the **convenience of having anything you want on the lock screen will be for you the game changer that's already been for me** during the months of development and refinement of the app this summer.

**Get Link HUB for free from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1524351956)** and _immediately unlock_ the power of your iPhone's lock screen!
