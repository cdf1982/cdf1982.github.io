My beloved ðŸ¤¯ emoji pretty much sums up the beginning of WWDC week: yesterday's Keynote and State of the Union contained so much, it's not easy to unpack and process everything.

I've [already](https://twitter.com/cdf1982/status/1135653180195450880) [tweeted](https://twitter.com/cdf1982/status/1135667752281280512) [some](https://twitter.com/cdf1982/status/1135674984012103682) [thoughts](https://twitter.com/cdf1982/status/1135669327187927041), [mostly without snark](https://twitter.com/cdf1982/status/1135685124463439872), because I honestly believe Apple delivered an **amazing series of announcements in a tightly-packed and completely fun to watch presentation**, but the blog is a much better place for non-reactive comments and it will be entertaining - at least for me - to revisit this post in a few years, as I can now do with [2017's]({{ site.baseurl }}/2017/06/06/wwdc_2017.html).

Throughout the week I should be able to post my thoughts and impressions, so hopefully you'll decide to stay tuned by subscribing via [RSS](cdf1982.com/feed.xml).

*Oh, while you're here, I also have a great plan figured out that involves lots and lots of [GlanceCam](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glancecam-ip-webcam-viewer/id1360797896?l=it&ls=1&mt=12) sales* ðŸ¤‘*:*
