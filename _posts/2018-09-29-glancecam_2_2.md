GlanceCam 2.2 has just been [released](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glancecam-ip-webcam-viewer/id1360797896?l=it&ls=1&mt=12)!

This is a minor update that:

* Fixes little visual glitches with Mojave: now GlanceCam, which has always had a cool dark interface, looks and works great with the latest macOS.

* Introduces useful keyboard shortcuts to switch between cameras: just press + or the spacebar to show the next camera and, you won't believe it, the - key to return to the previous one.

Multi-camera support (meaning, multiple cameras shown at the same time in a single window) is proving a harder task than expected, and lately I haven't been able to work on that as much as I would have liked to, but it's still coming...
