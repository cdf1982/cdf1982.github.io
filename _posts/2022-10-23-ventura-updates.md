I'm happy to announce that all my Mac apps have just been updated for macOS 13 Ventura, which launches tomorrow:

- **[GlanceCam 3.6](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glancecam-ip-webcam-viewer/id1360797896)!** works great on macOS 13 Ventura and is amazing in combination with Stage Manager, behaving exactly as you'd expect: with Always on Top enabled, your cameras remain visible in all Stages, just like they did (and do) with Spaces; if you don't use Always on Top in combination with Stage Manager, GlanceCam behaves like all other apps, moving to the side when you switch applications... but your camera preview remains live on the left sidebar even when it's not on the main stage!<br>This version also introduces an optional **Zoom** feature that's been requested by some Users a while back (thank you both for the suggestion and patience, Gretar and Olof!); you can find out more about how Zoom mode works in GlanceCam in the [release notes]((https://cdf1982.com/glancecam/glancecam-release-notes#3_6).

- **[Link HUB 2.2.1](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1524351956)** has been tweaked to be the best links manager and launcher on the latest version of macOS.

- **[ClipBar 1.4.2](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clipbar-pasteboard-viewer/id1541739143)** is a minor update – just to smooth things out for Ventura – to my utility for viewing the content of your Pasteboard from the status bar.

- **[TameTime 1.4.2](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tametime-awareness-timer/id1479326723)** perfects macOS 13 compatibility of my status bar utility built for reminding you of taking regular breaks, so you don't spend too much time sitting at your computer and risk compromising your health.

And since pushing 2 GlanceCam versions in one week, plus Ventura updates for all three other Mac apps currently in my portfolio wasn't enough, **[PhotosUpload 1.4.1](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photosupload/id1441656535)**, my FTP uploader for iPhone and iPad, has been updated for iOS and iPadOS 16 too!
