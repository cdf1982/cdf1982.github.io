I'm a few days late with this post, as both updates are already available in the App Store:

- **[Walk More 1.5](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1198077980?mt=8&at=1000l3L9&ct=website)** asks the User's authorization before accessing the IDFA identifier of the device to show targeted ads in the free version; I think Apple did great introducing this, and I wanted my app to support this privacy-focused feature on day one, and indeed this update shipped the same day as iOS 14.

- **[PhotosUpload 1.3](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1441656535?mt=8&at=1000l3L9&ct=website)** is a maintenance update for iOS 14 that also fixes some visual glitches on iOS 13.

Soon I'll also have a major announcement regarding my newest app, [Link HUB](https://cdf1982.com/link-hub.html)... stay tuned!
