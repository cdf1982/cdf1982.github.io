After an amazingly quick Sunday app review, Walk More 1.2 is here. **[Download it](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/walk-more-powerful-pedometer-for-step-counting/id1198077980?mt=8&at=1000l3L9&ct=website)** for free and tell your friends about it!

This new version introduces two localizations, Simplified Chinese and Italian, and the possibility to brag about your steps count via the iOS share sheet.

A quick note that will probably be of interest only for other fellow developers: before submitting, I've noticed a warning in iTunes Connect regarding my in-app purchases. Turns out that consumable IAPs that remove ads need to be replaced, since Apple wants that kind of behavior to be restorable and available across devices, which completely makes sense.
So, I kept the good and great "tip" in-app purchases (changing their tiers to the alternate categories with round values in the process) and replaced the "small tip" with a new "remove ads" non consumable IAP before submitting version 1.2. The approval process went smoothly, even though after submitting I worried about the lack of a restore button, usually requested for restorable purchases (I'll add it in the next version, just to be safe).

After this minor update, I have quite a few ideas for Walk More's future, but they'll be put in the parking lot™️ for a while: my August will be completely focused on the development of Tasktic 2.0.
