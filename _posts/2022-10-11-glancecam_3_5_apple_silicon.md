After 👏 _SO_ 👏 _MUCH_ 👏 _WORK_ 👏 **GlanceCam 3.5 for Apple silicon is [now available in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glancecam-ip-webcam-viewer/id1360797896?l=it&ls=1&mt=12)!**!

GlanceCam is a powerful and beloved IP Camera viewer for Mac:

This new release – the 24th free update since launch in 2018 – lays the foundations for the next 10+ years of GlanceCam.

The performance difference you'll notice on new Macs proves the effort was worth it: **CPU and RAM usage decrease significantly**, while everything else works as reliably as you're used to!

Please know it wasn't for _lack of trying_ that this major update didn't ship earlier: while Rosetta2 granted excellent performances in the transition period, I've been at work on native support since Apple's announcement, getting a DTK on day one.
After _many_ challenges, and thanks to the kind Beta Testers who helped me make this new version work great, the future of GlanceCam is brighter than ever.

As for new features, rest assured that with this major step forward finally in Users' hands, plenty is coming!

**You can [download GlanceCam 3.5](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glancecam-ip-webcam-viewer/id1360797896?l=it&ls=1&mt=12)! now**; if you're already a User, **it would mean the world to me if you took a moment to leave a 5-star review** 😉 or maybe even consider going Pro if you aren't already (or leave a tip if you are). And, as always, please don't hesitate to **[get in touch](mailto:support@cdf1982.com)**: I love feedback and feature requests!
