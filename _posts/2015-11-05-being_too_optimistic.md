As it happens when you don't account for delays, I've made a mistake: I planned to launch [Tasktic](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/tasktic-manage-your-tasks/id1036139076?mt=8&at=1000l3L9&ct=blog) today, November 5, and I announced the date when I submitted the app to the App Store Review.

Turns out, **I've been a little too optimistic about the approval time**, also because I had to fix a small error I made not with the app itself, but with the metadata submitted to Apple: the app name I initially chose was a bit too long and explanatory, so I've had to shorten it to "Tasktic - manage your tasks, not a task manager".

I'm very sorry to miss my own, self-imposed launch date. **Tasktic will launch very very soon, I'll let you know [here](http://www.cdf1982.com/blog/?format=rss) and [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/taskticapp) as soon as it's approved**.
