About 11 months after the [previous milestone](https://cdf1982.com/2023/11/30/500.html), my IP camera viewer for Mac, [GlanceCam](https://www.glancecam.app), **reached 600 Mac App Store ratings today**.

While the average rating in that period has been 4.47, numbers are "sticky", so the overall average hasn't really moved: it was and still is 4.2 stars. Which is honestly pretty good considering the niche the app is in and the technical barrier configuring cameras sometimes poses.

I want to thank all Users coming along for this journey, taking the time to leave such nice and encouraging reviews, and often provide great suggestions for new features

To the next 100 ratings!
