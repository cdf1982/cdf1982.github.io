[GlanceCam 3](https://glancecam.app) launched [last week](https://cdf1982.com/2021/03/11/glancecam_3.html) and, for such a niche product, I couldn't be happier:

- Lots of Users reached out via email to let me know they've been waiting for multi-windows for a long time and loved the implementation;
- No dangerous bug or crash ruined the experience;
- Sales spiked more than I have expected (the ratio among lifetime unlocks and yearly subscriptions also surprised me: it's currently 4 to 1); of course the rush is now almost over, but still, it was nice while it lasted;
- Cherry on top: [iMore](https://www.imore.com/glancecam-puts-all-your-ip-cameras-their-own-window-your-mac) wrote about it!

So, I've decided to **celebrate by reflecting on my mistakes in the 2 years that took me to launch GlanceCam 3,** or I should say _the mistakes I made causing me to take 2 years to ship it_.

I'll try to keep this of reasonable length and actionable to other indie developers:

1. **Lack of focus**: I started working on multi-windows in March 2019 and since then I've shipped 5 [medium-size updates](https://cdf1982.com/glancecam/glancecam-release-notes) to GlanceCam, launched 3 small new apps ([PhotosUpload](https://cdf1982.com/photosupload.html), [Link HUB](https://cdf1982.com/photosupload.html) and [ClipBar](https://cdf1982.com/clipbar.html)), updated [Walk More](https://cdf1982.com/walk-more.html) and [Tame Time](https://cdf1982.com/tametime.html), and spent 5 months on an unfinished Catalyst project I still very much hope to complete some day (it's _almost there..._).<br> With a day job (I work in a completely unrelated field to programming) **I can't do that**: if I'm lucky (and able to actually get up at 4.30 a.m.) I have 2.5 hours per morning during the week and a little more time on Saturdays and Sundays to program.<br>I need to **pick my battles carefully** and I **can't give myself the illusion of being productive because I work on too many things at once**.
2. You guessed it, as it goes hand in hand with the first mistake: **lack of motivation**. If you don't make progress on something for a long time, you start procrastinating... maybe even launch 3 different apps instead of working on the only one that generates a little revenue.<br>When you [planned over and over](https://twitter.com/cdf1982/status/1347808737537519617) to work on something and don't make tangible progress, it's a very dangerous place for that project to be in.<br>**Things need to keep moving or they die.**<br>I feel lucky to have been able to finally find the willpower to really put my head down and work for almost 300 hours on GlanceCam this year (since January, outside of my day job I haven't done anything but coding, talking walks with [Milla](https://www.instagram.com/millakillapilla/), eat, work and [do very stupid things](https://twitter.com/cdf1982/status/1366487762002726916) to my sleep-cycle), but I realise it was an unreasonable and unbalanced way to get both my and my app's mojos back.
3. **Branching proliferation**: I wanted a big 3.0 with multi-windows, new Preferences and much more, so my idea was to keep updating GlanceCam while working on the other features. Then, when I got stuck on difficult problems connected to multi-windows development, I started from scratch again and again (branches: multiwindows_take2, 3 and 4, which finally shipped) while also concurrently working on Preferences and even custom one-off features I sent to some Users who asked for tweaks. Merging was a nightmare, because in the meantime the shipping app progressed.<br>If time is constrained,**do ONE thing, finish it, move to the next.**
4. **Aiming for the stars**: a big 3.0 was a reasonable desire, and indeed I don't think some press would have mentioned a camera viewer if it was a smaller update, but before this long release-cycle I was always **smart enough to build small updates and ship them in a timely fashion**.<br>I'm returning to my better habits already, as GlanceCam 3.1 has already been submitted for review, but **finding balance between frequent releases and their depth is very important**, and probably will continue to be a struggle in the future, for instance when I'll start thinking of GlanceCam 4 (or maybe of the much requested iOS version that's more of a _new app_ altogether... I'm learning, I can see that's dangerous for focus and branching proliferation).
5. **Managing project-related informations**: during the weekend I [asked other developers](https://twitter.com/cdf1982/status/1370753619356745729) about their tools for keeping track of their work, feature requests, bugs and ideas and got very good answers. In that thread I've also shared where my journey on this ended (not far from where it started, OmniFocus, but with [better structure](https://twitter.com/cdf1982/status/1370981589199556608)).<br>Working on different things at the same time, in different directions and on multiple apps, I've let my to-do lists slip a bit, then more than a bit, until they got stale and their periodical review became painful and stopped happening.<br>I know better than that: **my mind works best if I have a single stop between home and work, a single and up-to-date bucket for everything that's related on planning and developing a project**.

I'm sure I've made plenty of other mistakes _(letting a single feature request derail my plans, allowing a review to mess with my mood, starting work on something [before doing the appropriate research and due diligence](https://twitter.com/cdf1982/status/1370607545581178891), leaving marketing to the last few days, even building a whole new [website](https://glancecam.app) the day before launch...)_, but this is probably enough introspection for me to go through in one sitting, and for you to read... thank you for coming along, hopefully there was some lesson for you to extract from my mistakes!
