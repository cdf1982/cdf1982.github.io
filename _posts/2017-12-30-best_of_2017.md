It's been a while since the last time I wrote here, so I thought to stop by and do something different for this New Year's Eve: instead of posting my favorite things of 2017 on Twitter, [like I did last year](https://twitter.com/cdf1982/timelines/815234385796562944), I thought about making my "best of" post a bit more permanent here on the blog. 

I'll start by saying that, as far as music, movies and TV, I believe my picks for 2016 where stronger and will resist to the passage of time better than this year's, and overall I think 2017 hasn't been the best year possible for entertainment. Or almost everything else.

On the other hand, this year I've listened to so many amazing podcasts, making a selection was terribly difficult and, while I believe I picked my favorites, there's so much good stuff out there, and so little time to listen to it, that I should probably write more about the podcasts I enjoy in the future.

But let's start. Please add drumrolls after reading every category.

**Best song**: [Dear Hate, Maren Morris & Vince Gill](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/album/dear-hate-feat-vince-gill/1292305143?i=1292305145&mt=1&app=music&at=1000l3L9)

**Best album**: [Melodrama, Lorde](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/album/melodrama/1211010237?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l3L9)

**Best book**: [Raven Rock, Garrett M. Graff](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/raven-rock/id1013993131?mt=11&at=1000l3L9)

**Best movie**: [Dogville](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/movie/dogville/id268551058?mt=6&at=1000l3L9) (I know, I know, it is 14 years old... but I never saw it before; it would be really hard for me to pick a really good 2017 movie... maybe [Gifted](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/movie/gifted/id1223051043?mt=6&at=1000l3L9))

**Best TV show (debut)**: [Godless](https://www.netflix.com/it/title/80097141) (I know, a western... who would have thought?)

**Best TV show (continued)**: [Halt and Catch Fire](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/halt-and-catch-fire-season-4/id1260735611?mt=4&at=1000l3L9) final season... it started slowly but concluded a great show perfectly

**Best podcast**: NPR's [Up First](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510318/up-first)

**Best tech podcast**: [Welcome to Macintosh](https://www.macintosh.fm/), and especially episode 15 [The Orchard](https://overcast.fm/+ELuVUuhP4)

**Best investigative reporting podcast**: I'm stretching the category a bit and choose [What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law](https://trumpconlaw.com/)

**Best news article I read**: [How science found a way to help coma patients communicate](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/sep/05/how-science-found-a-way-to-help-coma-patients-communicate)

**Best videogame**: an easy one... [Super Mario Odissey](http://amzn.to/2BXyP0p)

**Most moving TV moment**: without a doubt, [this MSNBC interview with Vice President Biden](https://youtu.be/oYanqUi8iWs)

And that's all... here's to a great new year and best wishes!
