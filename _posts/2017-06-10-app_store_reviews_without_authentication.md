A few weeks ago I've realized that Apple made a huge improvement to the App Store user review system, and I haven't seen it mentioned anywhere: we can now leave ratings and reviews without authentication! No password required, no Touch ID... just tap Write a review or simply the stars.

Maybe this has been around for a while and I didn't notice, but if you haven't realized this was possible too, there's never been a better time to leave a review for your favorite apps!
