For the last few years, I‚Äôve made an habit of writing a short list of the best things I‚Äôve experienced in the last 12 months.

This is something I write mostly for myself, to be able to revisit these posts (and, previously, [tweets](https://mobile.twitter.com/cdf1982/timelines/815234385796562944)) in the future and maybe rediscover contents I enjoyed, but hopefully something I liked so much to be listed here will be enjoyable to whomever reads my blog too. Yes, the three of you ;)

For 2018, I‚Äôm mostly keeping the same categories of [2017]({{ site.baseurl }}/2017/12/30/best_of_2018.html); choosing podcasts was extremely easy, as it‚Äôs the media I consumed the most. I‚Äôve watched very little TV and read an embarrassing low number of books, so those categories were a bit harder, but I can live with my picks.

**Best song**: [Head Above Water by Avril Lavigne](https://itunes.apple.com/it/album/head-above-water/1435072853?i=1435072869); I also love the colors of the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKF6ghfcQic).

**Best album**: [A Star Is Born Soundtrack](https://itunes.apple.com/it/album/a-star-is-born-soundtrack/1434371867), and I haven't seen the movie yet. 

**Best book**: after loving the movie, I finally got around reading [Wild by Cheryl Strayed](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/wild/id458973772?mt=11) and it was even better. A part of me would love to walk the PCT sometimes during this life, but another part is sorely aware that it would also probably be the last thing happening in said life üëª... 

**Best movie**: Funny coincidence, I have an ex aequo and both movie star the same actress, Jessica Chastain, who I previously didn‚Äôt even know: [Miss Sloane](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4540710/) and [Molly‚Äôs Game](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4209788/).

**Best TV show**: I think this year has been pretty terrible for TV shows, and actually the best thing I‚Äôve watched, and the one I feel the most to recommend, is from 2008... [John Adams](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472027/) was truly a revelation and you should not miss it.

**Best podcast**: I‚Äôm going with an obscure choice here üòù... [Serial‚Äôs season 3](https://serialpodcast.org/season-three) was very, very good and I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs favorite of the year; if you, like me, didn‚Äôt love the first two seasons, give this one a chance, end especially to [episode 2](https://overcast.fm/+DfQNk9kgI) and [episode 8](https://overcast.fm/+DfQM4luoI).

**Best tech podcast**: I am an admirer of Brent Simmons and The Omni Group makes my favorite app (see the Mac app category below), so it‚Äôs not a surprise that the short interviews to Omni people by Brent in [The Omni Show](https://theomnishow.omnigroup.com/) were really enjoyable to me; I recommend 3 episodes to start, if you never listened to it: [Tami Snyder‚Äôs interview](https://overcast.fm/+K3-TuldGU), [How we built OmniFocus for the web](https://overcast.fm/+K3-Tb7w1Q) and [Tim Wood‚Äôs interview](https://overcast.fm/+K3-QvfQ-M).

**Best investigative reporting podcast**: Serial would obviously fit here too, and this was a competitive category with both [In The Dark‚Äôs season 2](http://www.apmreports.org/in-the-dark) and [Bundyville](https://www.opb.org/news/article/bundyville-occupation-podcast/) being really interesting, but I found [Bag Man](https://art19.com/shows/bagman) the most surprising, because I didn‚Äôt know anything about Spiro Agnew‚Äôs uncanny story.

**Best news article I read**: [The Patrician President and the Reporterette: A Screwball Story](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/opinion/george-hw-bush-maureen-dowd.html). I miss the times when Americans chose great human beings for the higher office in their land and, therefore, in the world.

**Best Mac app**: [OmniFocus 3](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) is an obvious winner for me: my day starts and ends in OmniFocus, and all the work that happens in between is mostly organized there; this new version with Tags and Dark Mode really makes me happy every day. I also have a runner up: [Xcode 10](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is an amazing IDE and I love it, every year it gets better and is a pleasure to use!

**Best iOS app**: Another competitive category... my most used app is by far [Overcast](https://itunes.apple.com/it/app/overcast/id888422857?mt=8), and I am positively impressed by [Working Copy](https://workingcopy.app/), that I started using a few weeks ago, but I have to give the award to [Shortcuts](https://itunes.apple.com/it/app/comandi/id915249334?mt=8): Apple showed us a compelling version of the automation future and, while I haven‚Äôt used it much so far and I don‚Äôt see replace the automations I have running on my Mac, the app is so well executed and promising that deserves the first spot.

**Best videogame**: I have played almost zero videogames during most of the year, but in the first few months I remember I was still enjoying [Super Mario Odissey](http://amzn.to/2BXyP0p), so yes, I‚Äôm picking the same game for two years in a row... but there‚Äôs a good chance that, if I had more time to play with it, this year‚Äôs best game would have been [Ori and the Blind Forest](https://youtu.be/vkiAy-H8k6o): the intro I‚Äôm linking to is a masterpiece and almost made me tear up, and I really want to play it in 2019.

**Best video**: This category had an oddly specific name in the previous years, ‚ÄúMost moving TV moment‚Äù, so I‚Äôm renaming and expanding it‚Äôs purpose... but it‚Äôs still pretty hard to pick just one thing with all the content, fun, serious and useful, that‚Äôs available online. I‚Äôm choosing something inspirational, since we‚Äôre starting a new year: Simone Giertz‚Äôs TED Talk [Why you should make useless things](https://youtu.be/c0bsKc4tiuY)

And these are my choices for 2018, a year that honestly I won‚Äôt miss. Let‚Äôs all have an amazing new year instead!
