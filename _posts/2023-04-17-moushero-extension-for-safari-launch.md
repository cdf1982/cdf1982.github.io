So... last week one of my automation journeys took an unexpected turn, and today I'm happy to introduce **[MousHero for Safari](https://cdf1982.com/moushero-for-safari)**, a brand new extension to bring URL-scheme superpowers to your browsing experience. 

MousHero allows to trigger URL actions by adding up to 3 **custom context menu items to Safari's right-click menu**.  
Just by right-clicking on a webpage, the User is able to **launch apps, services and automations** _(for instance with third party applications such as Shortcuts, Keyboard Maestro, Drafts, etc.)_, optionally passing the currently selected text as parameter.

For the longest time, I wanted to be able to *"do something"* with the selected text in Safari, easily and quickly passing what I see in the browser to automations I have built mostly in [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com), but also Shortcuts and [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/).

While Share extensions offer some export capabilities, they strictly allow the User to perform what they were coded for, usually requiring multiple clicks, while **MousHero can trigger anything that has a URL**.

I am not aware of any other Safari extension that allows such flexibility, so I built MousHero first and foremost for myself, but **if you like to save time and do cool things with your Mac, I'm pretty sure there's a use case for you** too... Here's a few things that are just a right-click away with this extension:
- Run Shortcuts passing the selection as parameter;
- Create a new note in Drafts with the selected text, or skip the note creation altogether and run the Drafts action on the selection directly;
- Open the Inbox project in [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) or add the selected text as task;
- Run a Keyboard Maestro macro passing the selection;
- Open a specific website in a new panel;
- Search the selected text on StackOverflow, Google Maps or any other website.

You can **[get MousHero on the Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/moushero-for-safari/id6447680045) now**, and I hope you'll find it useful every day!
