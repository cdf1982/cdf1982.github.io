5 years is a long time to work on an app, and yet I feel very lucky that I still love devoting my early mornings and week-ends to building new features for [GlanceCam](https://glancecam.app), my IP camera viewer for Mac.

I believe the most fun is actually yet to come, with the new _FlexiGlanceGrid_ mode debuting with GlanceCam 4 later this year, and many other nerdy and fun things I already have planned both for the standard and Pro versions. So much fun work ahead!

**I'm especially thankful for the Users who chose GlanceCam and provided me invaluable feedback and support**. I still find it incredible that something so niche I built for myself is used daily, and loved, by thousands of like-minded enthusiasts from all over this large, small world.

I appreciate you coming along for this journey and joining me wishing Happy Birthday, [GlanceCam](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/glancecam-ip-webcam-viewer/id1360797896?l=it&ls=1&mt=12)!

_P.S. I had this banner image from the [first birthday](https://cdf1982.com/2019/03/29/glancecam_is_one_year_old.html) and seemed like a nice throwback to simpler times, but of course these days the app sports the much more cool app icon made by [Becky](https://beckyhansmeyer.com) for GlanceCam 3, not that original clumsy attempt ad graphic design..._
