		<h3>Don't try to remember everything...</h3>
		<p>... probably you won't anyway. And that's a good thing: do you really want your brain to focus on remembering a list of things to do, or actually get them done?</p>
		<p>By default, when you <strong>quickly </strong><strong>add a task</strong> to Tasktic, that new task goes into your Inbox... but you can also create as many <strong>projects</strong> as you need (<em>family, work, books, shopping, trip to Italy...</em>), <strong>mark what's important</strong>, add <strong>tags</strong>&nbsp;(<em>Christina, John, calls to make,&nbsp;novel ideas, kitty, whatever...</em>) and <strong>d</strong><strong>etailed notes </strong>with automatic conversion of phone numbers, addresses, email and web addresses into actionable links.</p>
		<p>Every task can have an optional <strong>due date</strong> and, when you choose so, a <strong>notification</strong> (with a custom, subtle and elegant sound).</p>
		<p>And there's more:&nbsp;with our <strong>Siri and Reminders for Mac integration</strong>,&nbsp;adding new tasks will be effortless and fast, as it will be from most of your other apps thanks to <strong>Tasktic Share Extension</strong>.&nbsp;Reviewing your next tasks will also never require much time with <strong>Tasktic Today</strong>&nbsp;in Notification Center, and you can also use Tasktic right on your wrist, with <strong>Tasktic for Apple Watch</strong>!</p>

		<h3>Your external brain, always with you</h3>
		<p>We designed Tasktic to fit perfectly into the lifestyle of people who have never used an app like this before, as well as of experts of time-management methods. In both cases,&nbsp;you won't need to spend much time in Tasktic: you'll just start doing more things and be more relaxed!</p>
		<p>Tasktic has a secret up its sleeve: <strong>fanTasktic button</strong>, an adaptive button so intuitive we don't need to say anything else. You'll love to mark things done!</p>
		<p>To <strong>keep you motivated</strong>, Tasktic will provide useful <strong>statistics</strong> and will optionally reward your <strong>achievements</strong>&nbsp;with virtual awards.</p>
		<p>Tasktic is a <strong>universal app for iPhone, iPad </strong>(with multitasking support)<strong> and Apple Watch</strong> that takes advantage of the power of iCloud to securely <strong>sync all your tasks, projects and tags </strong>between your devices.</p>
		<p>Since privacy means a lot to us, we built Tasktic around a straightforward <a href="/privacy/tasktic_privacy_policy.html">privacy policy</a>&nbsp;we'd love you to read.</p>
